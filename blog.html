          <p>The team got ready to tackle the project by installing the required software. Unity, ARCore SDK for Unity and Android SDK got installed, with everyone on the team having the same versions to ensure compatibility.</p>

          <p>The Unity gym leader Olli Arkko taught the aspiring Unity devs the basics of unity and the usage of mixed reality package for Unity.</p>

          <p>Aalto's version control was chosen as the team's go-to code center, where the code can rest and recover. Discord was chosen as the team's primary voice communication service, and Slack as the text communication service.</p>

          <p>For backlog management the team chose Trello for its simplicity and efficiency.</p>

            Now that the team is all set up and ready to go, they start developing a simple version of a maze and the character in it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Trello backlog consists of a basic character and its movement, working on missing / flawed course documents, image recognition and a very basic implementation of randomized level generation. Walls are built and lessons are learned as the team works together.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team was able to estimate a reasonable scope for the backlog and all planned tasks were done. Now we have a working demo!
          </p>

            Everyone was sleeping and little progress was made. That didn't mean the Team Reality's game didn't get better!
          </p>

          <p>
            The team finished the 3D modeling the floor of the maze, and creating a particle system for flame traps and initial version of spike traps.

            Preparations for menu were also made! Clicking the cog icon in the left upper corner of the screen opens a menu which is used to enable and disable features.

          <p>
            The gang set out to give the maze and its player a visual makeover. It was a great success but due to the complexity of the team’s beautiful creations, phones now struggled to keep a steady framerate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work on cloud rendering officially started but progress proved to be even slower than expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            A barbarian model for the player, performance metrics, wall textures and shaders were the main features the team finalized during this sprint.

          <p>
            The fifth development sprint was not quite as prolific as the former sprints. This was mainly due to cloud rendering being a big obstacle and taking up most of the team’s time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cloud rendering still isn’t done, but the team was able to render something resembling a maze through the cloud. Progress is still slow but the people working on the implementation now have a much better understanding of it.
